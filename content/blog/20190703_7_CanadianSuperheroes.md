Canada, Explain Yourself: Canada Gooses (https://youtu.be/MWQAJxQfayo)

Most of the list was taken from "7 Most Canadian Superheroes Ever" by Mental Floss (https://tinyurl.com/yyyrr8j6).

The "Guardians of the North" article from Library and Archives Canada (https://tinyurl.com/d4ha3b) provided a lot of details on various Canadian heroes, especially on the history of superheroes in Canadian comics.

Here's Ryan's City of Heroes character, True North (TM do not steal) (https://tinyurl.com/y2umhfv4)

The "Joe Shuster" article on Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Shuster) has details on his time in Canada, but this CBC article (https://tinyurl.com/y3sndql7) and this Superman Homepage article (https://tinyurl.com/y2zkla2g) have more detail on the Canadian influences on the comic.

Here's a picture of Captain Canuck from his first comic (https://tinyurl.com/y6zwhfr6) and here he is in the new Chapterhouse Comics series (https://tinyurl.com/yxhe3epg).

This story talks about how groundbreaking Alpha Flight was for its time.(https://tinyurl.com/y85tjsfj)

And as for Geoff Stirling's Captain Canada, you can read more about the Atlantis graphic novel from this Comic Book Daily article(https://tinyurl.com/y3uk6f3c), and... just read this. Trust me.(https://tinyurl.com/y6c39mod)
