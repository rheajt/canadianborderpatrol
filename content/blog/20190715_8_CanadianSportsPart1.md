The CBC's "Biggest Moments in Canadian Sports History" list (https://tinyurl.com/y6dedyqw) was a great source of info for this episode.

You can see every Hockey Night In Canada opening in this video (https://youtu.be/Y6WE3z_--HU, or https://youtu.be/Y6WE3z_--HU?t=348 if you just want the one we played on the show).

For more on the Donovan Bailey Fastest Man controversy, check out the related section of Bailey's Wikipedia article (https://tinyurl.com/yyoz2u59) and the Bailey-Johnson 150m race article (https://tinyurl.com/y5n6cmky).

This CBC article (https://tinyurl.com/y4g75s2r) revisits the Gushue rink's win. Apparently, Mark Nichols didn't have a 100% accuracy, but he did have a 97% accuracy, so let's call it a rounding error.

This video (https://youtu.be/lMf2fAXPS1Q) shows Henderson's Summit Series winning goal and the (very 70s) reaction.

Don't forget to check out the Coach's Corner Transcribed videos we used, "No Time Left" (https://youtu.be/4FFq6bblau0) and "Tyler Toffoli" (https://youtu.be/9bZkONoi15E). If you liked them, here's the channel page (https://tinyurl.com/y2f48ezs).
